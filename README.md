# Neural Network Exercises Repository

This repository contains solutions to the given neural network exercises using Python, with each exercise implemented in a separate Jupyter notebook. These exercises aim to help you understand some aspect of neural networks and genetic algorithms.

## Table of Contents

1. [Exercise 1 - Thresholds and Neurons](exercice1.ipynb)
2. [Exercise 2 - Genetic Algorithm and Activation Functions](exercice2.ipynb)
3. [Exercise 2bis - Hidden Layer and Optimization](exercice2.ipynb)
4. [Exercise 3 - Handwritten Digit Recognition](exercice3.ipynb)
5. [Exercise 4 - Invariant Matrix](exercice4.ipynb)
6. [Exercise 5 - Image Processing with Neural Networks](exercice5.ipynb)

## Installation

To run these notebooks, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer. You can install them using the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

Additionally, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- scipy
- scikit-image
- matplotlib
- pandas

### Using VSCode Task

If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can use the included task to install the required libraries:

1. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) to open the Command Palette.
3. Type "Run Task" in the Command Palette and select "Tasks: Run Task".
4. Choose the task you've created for installing the requirements (e.g., "install dependencies with pip" or "install dependencies with pip3" depending of your version).

The task will automatically install the necessary libraries for you.

This will open a browser window displaying the list of notebooks in the repository. Click on a notebook to open it and execute the cells.
